Exercises Solutions to these exercises are available on Moodle. You can download a template RMarkdown file to start from here. We will look at (simulated) data from a study that looked at the effectiveness of chemotherapy for treating colon cancer. Chemotherapy is effectively a poison that kills cells in the body that are rapidly proliferating: these cells include the cancer cells (often in a mass called a tumor) but also cells in bone marrow involved in sustaining the immune system. In this study, researchers measured the following variables: pre_tumor_size: Tumor size at the start of the study (Small or Large). treated: ChemoYes if the patient received chemotherapy or ChemoNo if not. post_tumor_size: Tumor size 3 months after the start of the study (Small or Large). recovery: Yes if the patient fully recovered from their cancer after 1 year. No otherwise. You can read in the data as follows: chemo_study_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/vl06j75a8afw8ct/chemo_study.csv?dl=1&quot;) Exercise 1: Plots and confounders The first step in any data analysis is to visualize your data. Let's refamiliarize ourselves with the ggplot2 package in R. It may be helpful to have this ggplot2 cheat sheet open. Make sure to load the ggplot2 package by including library(ggplot2) at the top of your RMarkdown document. Get a feel for the data by visualizing the distributions of all 4 variables individually (4 plots total). Your code should look something like below. ggplot(chemo_study_data, aes(x = pre_tumor_size)) + ??? Is pre-treatment tumor size predictive of whether or not a patient received chemotherapy? Make a plot to assess this, and briefly state what conclusions can be drawn from the plot. (Hint: it will be helpful to look at the second page of the cheat sheet in the section labeled &quot;Position Adjustments&quot;.) ggplot(chemo_study_data, aes(x = pre_tumor_size, fill = treated)) + ??? Is pre-treatment tumor size predictive of whether or not a patient recovered? Make a plot, and briefly state your conclusions. A variable is a confounder if it is a common cause of both the treatment and outcome. This is shown in the diagram below. Given your results from parts b and c, could pre-treatment tumor size be a confounder of the relationship between chemotherapy treatment and recovery? Could post-treatment tumor size be a confounder of the relationship between chemotherapy treatment and recovery? Support your answer with plots and an explanation. Note: the causal relationships of interest so far can be depicted in a causal diagram, shown below. An arrow between two variables indicates that one is a cause of the other (an arrow points from a cause to its effect). Exercise 2: Implications of confounding What is the relationship between confounders and the saying &quot;Correlation does not imply causation&quot;? Explain how regression models can be used to remove the influence of confounding variables. Suppose that chemotherapy generally works to promote recovery. Suppose also that sicker patients tend to receive chemotherapy, and healthier patients tend to not receive chemotherapy. What would you expect if you directly compared recovery rates in the chemotherapy and standard of care patients (no adjustments for other variables)? What would you expect if you held appropriate confounders constant? Exercise 3: Logistic regression models We can model recovery using a logistic regression model (used when the outcome variable is binary). In R, we can fit a logistic regression model using code like the following: # Fit the model and store it in the &quot;mod&quot; object mod &lt;- glm(outcome_variable ~ predictor_variable1+predictor_variable2, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = your_data) # Display model output summary(mod) # Obtain confidence intervals (CIs) for model coefficients # (95% CIs by default) confint(mod) Fit a logistic regression model with only treatment as a predictor. Interpret the treatment coefficient. Is the sign of the coefficient what you expected? Why is this model misleading? Fit a logistic regression model that adjusts for pre-treatment tumor size. Interpret the treatment coefficient. Is the sign of the coefficient what you expected? Also report the 95% confidence interval for the treatment coefficient and what information you learn from it. (Side note: This article by Eleanor Murray has a great explanation of the most common misinterpretation of confidence intervals.) Fit a logistic regression model that adjusts for pre- and post-treatment tumor size. Interpret the treatment coefficient. Is the sign of the coefficient what you expected? Exercise 4: Warming up to causal ideas Consider the statement: &quot;The causal effect of chemotherapy on recovery rates (as compared to no chemotherapy) is a change (difference) of 10%.&quot; What do you think &quot;causal effect&quot; means? What would you like it to mean? Which model do you think best estimates the causal effect of chemotherapy on recovery rates? Explain. "],
["exchangeability.html", "Topic 2 Exchangeability Pre-class work Learning Goals Exercises", " Topic 2 Exchangeability Pre-class work Videos/slides Defining Causal Effects: [video], [slides] Exchangeability: [video], [slides] Checkpoint questions: Link to Moodle checkpoint Which of the following is an example of an example of an average causal effect? Select all that apply. \\(E[Y^{a=1}]\\) \\(E[Y^{a=0}]\\) \\(E[Y^{a=1}]/E[Y^{a=0}]\\) \\(Y^{a=1}-Y^{a=0}\\) \\(E[Y^{a=1}-Y^{a=0}]\\) We want to estimate the causal effect of a new medication (treatment group) on cholesterol levels as compared to the medication that is currently the standard of care (control group). (The potential outcomes represent potential cholesterol levels.) Fatty food consumption is likely a factor that would lead to lack of exchangeability of the treated and untreated if doctors use fatty food consumption in their choice of medication to prescribe. Increased fatty food consumption generally leads to higher cholesterol levels. Suppose that the new medication truly does lead to lower cholesterol levels than the standard of care. Which of the following are correct? If those prescribed the new medication have HIGHER fatty food consumption than those prescribed the standard of care, then the beneficial impact of the new drug will be overestimated when directly comparing the treatment to the control group. If those prescribed the new medication have HIGHER fatty food consumption than those prescribed the standard of care, then the beneficial impact of the new drug will be underestimated when directly comparing the treatment to the control group. If those prescribed the new medication have LOWER fatty food consumption than those prescribed the standard of care, then the beneficial impact of the new drug will be overestimated when directly comparing the treatment to the control group. If those prescribed the new medication have LOWER fatty food consumption than those prescribed the standard of care, then the beneficial impact of the new drug will be underestimated when directly comparing the treatment to the control group. Continuing the medication-cholesterol example, what are two factors (other than fatty food consumption) that could contribute to a lack of exchangeability of the treatment groups? Explain your reasoning. Conditional exchangeability is marginal exchangeability within subsets of the data. TRUE FALSE Suppose that marginal exchangeability of the treated and untreated holds. Among the treated, we observe a mean outcome of 10. Among the untreated, we observe a mean outcome of 8. What can be said about \\(Y^{a=0}\\) among the treated and about \\(Y^{a=1}\\) among the untreated? We don't know anything about those quantities because they are unobserved. Among the treated, the mean \\(Y^{a=0}\\) is 10. Among the untreated, the mean \\(Y^{a=1}\\) is 8. Among the treated, the mean \\(Y^{a=0}\\) is 8. Among the untreated, the mean \\(Y^{a=1}\\) is 10. Learning Goals Define an average causal effect in terms of potential outcomes EXCH1: Apply the concepts of marginal and conditional exchangeability to answer questions about (hypothetical) data on potential outcomes. EXCH2: Give examples of when marginal and conditional exchangeability would and would not hold in various data contexts. EXCH3: Explain why a direct comparison of the outcomes in the treated and untreated is misleading as an estimate of a causal effect. Exercises Solutions to these exercises are available on Moodle. Navigate to PollEverywhere for some warm-up exercises. If you attended, how was First Thursday for you? Otherwise, what's a Mac tradition that you miss? Exercise 1 Suppose that we are trying to understand the causal effect of a personal finance course on the percent of earnings left in savings each month (abbreviated as &quot;percent savings&quot;). For the 500 people who took the course, we are able to collect data on percent savings and various other factors. We are also able to collect the same information from 500 people who did not take the course. Do you think that a comparison of percent savings in the course takers and non-takers would be a valid estimate of the average causal effect? Explain your viewpoint using the concepts of potential outcomes and exchangeability. One important factor to consider is the number of children that an individual has. Explain how this factor could contribute to a lack of exchangeability in the outcomes of the course takers and non-takers. As part of your explanation, discuss how observed outcomes compare to the missing potential outcomes. State any assumptions you make about the relationships between different factors. Do you think conditional exchangeability holds conditional on number of children? If yes, why? If no, what other factors might be needed to achieve conditional exchangeability? What is your thought process in thinking about other factors? Exercise 2 We have the data below on number of children (\\(Z\\)), treatment (course takers: \\(A = 1\\). course non-takers: \\(A = 0\\)), and the percent savings outcome (\\(Y^a\\)) categorized as either high (H) or low (L). Assuming that the course takers and non-takers are exchangeable conditional on number of children, estimate the average causal effect \\(P(Y^{a=1} = \\mathrm{high}) - P(Y^{a=0} = \\mathrm{high})\\). \\(n\\) \\(Z\\) \\(A\\) \\(Y^{a=1}\\) \\(Y^{a=0}\\) 10 2 1 7 H, 3 L ? 10 1 1 6 H, 4 L ? 10 0 1 5 H, 5 L ? 30 2 0 ? 18 H, 12 L 40 1 0 ? 20 H, 20 L 50 0 0 ? 20 H, 30 L Exercise 3 While \\(Y^a\\) denotes the potential outcome under treatment \\(A = a\\), \\(Y\\) denotes the observed outcome. (For the treated, \\(Y = Y^{a=1}\\). For the untreated, \\(Y = Y^{a=0}\\).) Is it possible for marginal exchangeability to hold but for \\(Y\\) and \\(A\\) to be dependent? Explain using a numerical or graphical example.

Only areas with the greatest need receive program benefits. Explain how this type of design is attempting to create exchangeability. Do you think that this design is effective in that goal? Explain.

Simulate data from causal graphs under linear and logistic regression structural equation models. Formulate use cases of simulation to understand causal inference concepts Simulating data in R You can download a template RMarkdown file to start from here. Why simulate? Simulation is a very powerful tool for understanding statistical ideas. We can simulate (generate) data where we know the true underlying distribution, and we can then see how statistical methods perform on this data. For example: Do 95% confidence intervals really contain the true population value in 95% of samples? When is this not true? Does regression work to estimate causal effects when we have conditional exchangeability? Simulation functions in R R has functions to work with several probability distributions. For example, the following 4 functions work with the normal distribution: rnorm(): Generate a random number from a normal distribution pnorm(): Tail probability from a normal distribution dnorm(): Get density value from a normal distribution qnorm(): Get a quantile from a normal distribution There are r, p, d, and q functions for other distributions too (e.g., runif(), rbinom().) We'll primarily use r functions to generate random numbers. rbinom(): # 4 different people each flip a fair coin once rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # 4 different people flip unfair coins # First 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.9 # Second 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.2 rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = c(0.9, 0.9, 0.2, 0.2)) # Write a command with rbinom() so that the result will definitively be 1,0,1 rnorm(): # 5 numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and SD 2 rnorm(5, mean = 10, sd = 2) # 3 numbers from 3 different normal distributions # Means = 10, 100, 1000. SD = 1 rnorm(3, mean = c(10, 100, 1000), sd = 1) # Write a command with rnorm() so that the result will definitively be 10,20 Simulating data from graphs+SEMs In this course, we'll simulate data that come from graphs and their corresponding structural equation models. We'll step through how to simulate data that come from this causal graph. Question: Using the Causal Markov Assumption, how can we express the joint distribution of this data? Consider the structural equation model (SEM) below that is associated with our causal graph: \\[ \\begin{align*} Z &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Z = 40, \\sigma_Z = 5) \\\\ A &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n = 1, p_A) \\\\ p_A: &amp;\\log\\left(\\frac{p_A}{1-p_A}\\right) = -1 + 0.05Z \\\\ Y &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y = 1) \\\\ \\mu_Y &amp;= 30 + 5A + 2Z \\end{align*} \\] \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation 5. \\(A\\) is binary (binomial/Bernoulli) with probability of success \\(p_A\\) \\(p_A\\) depends on \\(Z\\) via a logistic regression model. \\(Y\\) is quantitative and follows a normal distribution. The mean \\(\\mu_Y\\) depends on \\(A\\) and \\(Z\\) via a linear regression model. Complete the code below to simulate data that follow this structural equation model. # Sample size n &lt;- 10000 # Simulate the Z variable Z &lt;- rnorm(?) # Simulate the A variable log_odds_A &lt;- -1 + 0.05*Z odds_A &lt;- exp(log_odds_A) p_A &lt;- odds_A/(1+odds_A) A &lt;- rbinom(?) # Simulate the Y variable mean_Y &lt;- 30 + ? Y &lt;- ? # Store all simulated variables in a dataset called sim_data sim_data &lt;- data.frame(Z, A, Y) Reproducibility At the top of code chunks where you perform simulation, use the set.seed() function to ensure that when you rerun the code, you get the same results: set.seed(451) # Your simulation code Exercises Solutions to these exercises are available on Moodle. What's something that you enjoyed this long weekend? Exercise 1 Write the joint distribution of the data from the causal graph below using the Causal Markov Assumption. Then simulate data from the graph. You are free to choose your own structural equation model, but let \\(Z\\), \\(W\\), and \\(Y\\) be quantitative. Let \\(A\\) be binary. Use a sample size of 10,000 for your simulation. Based on the structural equation model you chose, what would you guess is the average causal effect of \\(A\\) on \\(Y\\)? Let's consider simulating interventions using your SEM. If you were to force all study units to receive a certain value of treatment (either 0 or 1), how do you think the causal graph would change? Modify your simulation to reflect your thoughts from part c. Incorporate the code below into your simulation. # Scenario 1: Force all to be treated A_force_1 &lt;- rep(1, n) # Repeat the number 1 n times # Scenario 2: Force all to be treated A_force_0 &lt;- rep(0, n) # Repeat the number 0 n times # The treated potential outcome Y^{a=1} Y1 &lt;- ? # something with A_force_1 # The untreated potential outcome Y^{a=0} Y0 &lt;- ? # something with A_force_0 # Estimate the average causal effect mean(?)

Exercise 1 In judging the strength of evidence in research studies, it is important to critically evaluate the quality of data that the authors used. Read the Noise Exposure Assessment section of the paper. Briefly explain 2 concerns that you have about how the authors determined noise levels. (4 sentences max.) Exercise 2 Figure 1 shows (a simplified version of) the causal graph the authors used in their work. Write down the joint distribution of the data using the Causal Markov Assumption. Use the variable abbreviations below: D: Demography CD: Chronic diseases L: Lifestyle SES: Socioeconomic status NS: Noise sensitivity NA: Noise annoyance A: Road traffic noise Y: Sleep disturbances Exercise 3 In Figure 1, which parts of the graph generate causal effects of the treatment (road traffic noise) on the outcome (sleep disturbances)? State these explicitly. (No explanation required.) Are the observed outcomes across treatment levels a good representation of the missing potential outcomes? Which parts of the graph are relevant to look at to answer that question? (Describe this in general terms rather than stating all of them.) How do these parts of the graph create misleading associations? Explain in terms of relevant graph building block structures and exchangeability. (4 sentences max.) Exercise 4 Consider a modified version of the Figure 1 graph shown below. How can you identify a set of variables \\(Z\\) that will result in conditional exchangeability of the treatment groups? Briefly explain how your proposed process achieves this. (4 sentences max.) Identify one possible set \\(Z\\). Show your work. Exercise 5 Here, you'll check if the set \\(Z\\) you identified in Exercise 4 works. Simulate data from a causal graph that has the same structure as the graph in Exercise 4. All variables should be quantitative except for the outcome \\(Y\\), which should be binary. Display output from an appropriate check. Exercise 6 Continuing from the causal graph in Exercise 4, suppose that the household income and physical activity variables were unmeasured. Use two different strategies to try to regain conditional exchangeability (at least approximately). (4 sentences max.) Exercise 7 What would the causal graph from Exercise 4 look like if this study had been a randomized experiment? You can draw the graph or explain how it would look different. Using this graph, make a connection between relevant graph concepts and marginal exchangeability. (4 sentences max.) Exercise 8 Pick one quasi-experimental study design and explain in a few sentences how it could be applied in the setting of this sleep study. (4 sentences max.) Exercise 9 (This exercise is not related to the sleep study.) Suppose that the treatment (\\(A\\)) groups are exchangeable conditional on \\(Z\\). Given the table of information below, compute the following average causal effects (showing your work): Overall ACE: \\(E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}]\\) ACE within \\(Z = A\\): \\(E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\mid Z = A]\\) ACE within \\(Z = B\\): \\(E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\mid Z = B]\\) (\\(Z\\) and \\(A\\) are binary, and \\(Y\\) is quantitative. \\(n\\) indicates the sample size for the 4 groups.) \\(n\\) \\(Z\\) \\(A\\) \\(E[Y\\mid A, Z]\\) 80 A 1 40 20 A 0 20 20 B 1 30 80 B 0 20 "]
