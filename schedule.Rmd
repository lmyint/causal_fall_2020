# Schedule {-}

The schedule below is a tentative outline of our plans for the module. If we need more time for digestion, there is flexibility in our plans to allow for that.

Before each class period, please watch the indicated videos, complete required readings, and complete the associated Moodle checkpoint.

For the most part, readings listed here are suggestions. They refer to sections in the PRIMER and WHATIF books (see [References](references.html)) and may be useful for alternate presentations of the concepts. When a reading is required, it will marked as **(REQD)**.
