# (PART) Project {-}

# Final Project {-}

There are a number of options available for the final project.

Grading scale:

- Not Assessable
- Needs Revisions
- Meets Expectations
- Excellent


<br><br>


## Deliverables {-}

For all projects below, the only deliverable is a "digital artifact" that could be used for the digital capstone showcase. A digital artifact can take any of the following forms:

- A video presentation
- A podcast-style recording
- A set of blog posts

Work with Leslie to determine the most suitable form for your digital artifact, depending on the option you pick.

<br>

**In order to earn an Excellent, your artifact must be presented in a way that is clear and engaging for a student who has only completed STAT 155.** Not every part of the artifact should be easily understood by an introductory student, but they should be able to take away some understanding even from the more advanced material.

## Option 1: Data analysis {-}

**Collaboration:** Groups of up to 3. Individual work is fine.

Perform a causal analysis on a dataset of your choice. To earn an Excellent, the analysis must contain one major component per team member.

Options for major components:

- Regression analysis for causal effect estimation with a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding
- Inverse probability weighting analysis for causal effect estimation with a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding
- Causal discovery as a sensitivity analysis (Information on the `pcalg` R package for causal discovery will be added to our website's appendix.)
- Mediation analysis for causal effect estimation
- Instrumental variables analysis

Resources for finding data:

- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
- [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/)
- [IPUMS](https://ipums.org/)

<br>

## Option 2: Blog posts {-}

**Collaboration:** Individual only.

Write two blog posts explaining causal inference ideas to a general audience. The first post should address one of the three topics below.

- Estrogens and uterine cancer example of selection bias: see [Graphical Structure of Selection Bias], Exercise 3.
- The smoking-birth weight paradox
- Pick any media item that has interested you. Write a reaction to it / an analysis of it from a causal inference perspective.
    - If you're looking to explore some media, the [Casual Inference podcast](https://casualinfer.libsyn.com/) is a fun one!

The second post should be a "tour of causal inference" and lead the reader through all topics covered in our course in a cohesive story.

<br>

## Option 3: Learn an advanced topic {-}

**Collaboration:** Groups of up to 3. Individual work is fine.

Dig deeper into course topics or learn a new topic. Examples could include:

- Methods for transportability (generalizability) of effects
- Interference
- Details of methods for time-varying treatments
- Specialized considerations for particular study designs

<br>

## Option 4: Other {-}

If none of these options piques your interest, I'm happy to discuss alternatives with you.
