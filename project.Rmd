## Option 1: Data analysis {-}

**Collaboration:** Groups of up to 3. Individual work is fine.

With larger groups, the number of major components required to earn an Excellent will increase.

Options for major components

- Complete regression analysis for causal effect estimation with a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding
- Complete inverse probability weighting analysis for causal effect estimation with a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding
- Causal discovery as a sensitivity analysis
- Complete mediation analysis for causal effect estimation with a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding

<br>

## Option 2: Blog posts {-}

**Collaboration:** Individual only.

Choose __ (number TBD) of the following topics to fully explain through blog posts. One post per topic.

- Estrogens and uterine cancer example of selection bias: see [Graphical Structure of Selection Bias], Exercise 3.
- The smoking-birth weight paradox
- More to come!

## Option 3: Create a lesson {-}

**Collaboration:** TBD

Create a lesson plan for one of our course topics. This lesson plan will include

<br>

## Option 4: Literature critique {-}

**Collaboration:** TBD, probably individual

Write a thorough critique of a research article that uses causal inference methods.

<br>

## Option 5: Learn an advanced topic {-}

**Collaboration:** TBD

Dig deeper into course topics or learn a new topic. Examples could include:

- Methods for transportability (generalizability) of effects
- Interference
- Details of methods for time-varying treatments
- Specialized considerations for particular study designs

<br>

## Option 6: Other {-}

If none of these options piques your interest, I'm happy to discuss alternatives with you.
